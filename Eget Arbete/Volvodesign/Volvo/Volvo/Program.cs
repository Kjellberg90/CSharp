//Task1
//Volvo design bureau or fun with inheritance. 

//Create a blueprint for a different a 3 different type of cars(crossover, sedan, truck).

//Provide as much details and common actions in a base classes as possible.
//Each car have engine, with a serial number, car have vin number, consider
//adding 6 more components and make sure that if blueprint is created, it cannot be changed later on.

//Build at least 3 blueprints(and as many classes as you want) and make sure that there are
//no code duplications among them.

//Task2
//Warehouse evolution or fun with collections.

//Create a linear inventory of cars(car can be build from a blueprint).
//V60
//XC90
//V40
//V40
//V60
//XC90
//XC40 EV

//Add two new items xc40 after xc90 and move them to the end of the list.
//Add classification to the each model, crossover or sedan
//Add the price.
//Sort inventory by car type and price.

//Now let's introduce storage spaces to warehouse. 
//We have a dedicated space for crossovers, that is bigger than other space for smaller cars. 
//Each storage section have unique names and can accept only specific model. 

//Consider the key value pair  collection like dictionary or hash set.
